## Progressive enhancement

The accordion was implemented such that all its content is accessible without any JavaScript. Extra functionality is added to the accordion via JavaScript if it is enabled in the user's browser. Progressively enhancing the accordion ensures that the visibility of its content does not depend on JavaScript running in the browser.
