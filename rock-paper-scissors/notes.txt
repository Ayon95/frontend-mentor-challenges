--------- How to make a random selection for the computer ---------

- generate a random number between 0 and 4 so that each option has an equal chance of being selected
- 0 = rock, 1 = paper, 2 = scissors, 3 = lizard, 4 = spock

-------- How to determine who wins --------

const prey = {
    'rock': ['scissors', 'lizard'],
    'paper': ['rock', 'spock'],
    'scissors': ['paper', 'lizard'],
    'lizard': ['paper', 'spock'],
    'spock': ['rock', 'scissors']
}

- if userSelection === computerSelection, then it's a tie
- if prey[userSelection].includes(computerSelection), then user wins
- otherwise, computer wins

Example:

userSelection = 'rock';

// user wins
computerSelection = 'scissors' OR 'lizard';

// computer wins
computerSelection = 'paper' OR 'spock';

// tie
computerSelection = 'rock';
